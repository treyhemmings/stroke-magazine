Nourishing a Dangerous Mind
Jannis Kounellis Untitled, 1991–2011 Ceramic plate, kitchen knife, wooden chair, two goldfish, water
Jannis Kounellis creates environments that confront us with obstacles, where everyday objects become charged with tension.
A knife before a fish is simply an object. A knife before a human is a weapon.
Danger resides not in the blade, but in the mind that perceives it. So too with one’s encounter at MONA.
